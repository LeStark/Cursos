"When I opened the micro disc and adapter I did't know what to do with them. I went to UTube on installing them, and all became clear. The micro fits into the top of the adapter and then the whole thing fits into my camera. Very neat and high powered.",positive
"I purchased this product knowing there might be an issue with the galaxy s4. This card worked for a week or two then began to spontaneously unmount and would mount itself back in. The unmount periods began to become longer than a few hours, days! I tried this card in a galaxy note 2 still with the same result. I attempted to contact Sandisk customer service and utilize the warranty. They know of the problem and began the exchange process then instructed me to wait for a mailing label that never came. I called back and was told that they would re-email it to me. To this day I am still waiting for that email. I have never had this issue with this company but with  ever changing technology, it is what it is, right? I know this card will be good for some device I have. If you own a galaxy phone beware!! I have not attempted to use this in a samsung tablet so on that I cannot review.",negative
"Bought October 7th. Passed away December 23rd. RIP.I didn't really even use it because of the built in storage on my GS3. I had about 15 gb of music and movies on it, but only for when I was unexpectedly bored and without my zuneHd. On to the next brand I guess.",negative
"This was an inexpensive way to get my Galaxy Note II from 16GB to 32GB of memory. Its plenty fast and can hold lots of photos, music, etc.",positive
"Works well, and fast, does everything it claims to do.  These sshd items are the best.  You cannot hurt them, and they last forever.",positive
"Bought this for my S3 and loaded it with 4 seasons of Futurama, 5 full length HD movies, several documentaries, and a dozen or so 30 minute comedy shows with plenty of room left over for pictures, etc...Only slight nitpick is when booting up into recovery mode on the S3 it will not recognize the card. Wanted to update the phone to the latest version of Android and it would not see it. Had to resort to a 2GB MicroSD I had laying around. That wasn't a SD card issue but I thought I would throw that in.",negative
Product arrived on time not excessively packaged. Worked perfectly out of the box. Speed is excellent as I can play movies on it and the large file transfer time is very quick on the tablet.,positive
"Well i got it for my go pro hero 3. the hero 3 takes this instead of regular sd cards, it seems to be working fine and its the same type that go pro sells of of their site for the hero 3.",positive
"It performs very well & bought at good price. Works great on my S3 with no problems. i used before on my Samsung Epic but the phone had trouble using it , kept getting &#34;sd card suddenly removed&#34;  notification.",positive
It's a memory card and performs like it should: it stores data. I would recommend it for cameras and any other device that calls for storage with a SD card and adapter.,positive
"This card was used in a phone without a large amount of write stress (which does shorten the life of the card - it was not written to over and over in the phone).The card is now totally unwriteable - on a Mac, a Linux machine, or the phone - writes all ""seem"" to succeed but even low-level reformats don't actually *do* anything - the exact same files are there after every change, untouchable and frozen forever.10 months of use out of a memory card and then a really weird failure like this (neither the Mac, Linux machine, or phone reports any error) is not acceptable quality from SanDisk.",negative
"I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S3 because I could expand the memory, and this card is how I did it. The phone came with 16 Gb, and this cranked it up to 80 Gb for only about $65 more (buying this much memory already installed would have been much more expensive). I have about a half dozen albums, around 40 or 50 TV episodes, and maybe 16 full length movies on the card, with room to spare - very nice when sitting on a long plane ride! The only problem occurred the day after I put the card in - it gave me an error message, but when I removed and reseated the card, no problem, and none in the months since then.",negative
Works fine in a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - no need to format (although I did) - recognized as soon as it was popped in 59.47GB usable.Arrived really fast and nicely packaged.  I would order again.,positive
Purchased this along with the Nifty Minidrive for use as my Time Machine backup my Macbook Air 13&#34;. Perfect expansion!,positive
got it on time in a simple but secure packaging. inserted it and worked without issues. comes in a clear plastic case with an SD adapter. the is the typical SD case size.the sale price of $16 and change was great as well.love it!,positive
I have been using this in my phone for several months.  Still works great. Seems fast however i have not done any real tests.,neutral
"I've used many others, and this is average. Its in my son's android, and I don't really think the application its in right now is a the best way to determine its speed / performance.  Otherwise it does what i want it to.The adapter will come in handy later.",neutral
Not a whole lot to report other than the card has been working great so far in my S4.  No problems whatsoever.,positive
64 gb of fast microSD storage at a great price.  What's not to love?  Works perfectly with my 64gb Dell Venue Pro 8.,positive
Got this for the Dell Venue 8 Pro and it works perfectly. No complaints. Here are more words to complete my review.,positive
As new products evolve they only accept SD and microSD cards. I've had good luck with SanDisk and this is no exception.,positive
Unable to read.It says it's blank.It then prompts to format or cancel.I clicked Format but Unable to Format.,negative
"I formatted the card, saved the data from phone's 4 gb card to desktop, dragged and dropped the files from 4gb to 32 gb card. Installed 32 gb card in phone. Phone works perfectly. Win win.And a great deal for the price.",positive
"This card has lots of room for everything. A Class 10 card for about $20, you can not go wrong.",positive
I bought this for my 6yr old's Nabi tablet. Thing works perfectly allowing him to download music and games with ease. Loved the price and trust SanDisk products.,positive
Pluggesd in the MicroSd csrd and it worked perfectly!  SanDisk has a solid performer here.  I'd recommend this product to anyone neededing this level of storage and speed.,positive
"As expected, SanDisk delivered again with this card. Very fast transfers and a lot of data to use up. Bought it for a galaxy s 3 and it works great.",positive
"the first 2 I bought both had multiple problems with not being recognized, this one so far has had no problems.",positive
"Bought two separately.1) One was a frustration free package one was apparently a frustrating package. Both came in similar packages stuffed in large yellow envelopes. Don't really see the difference between the frustration free and frustrating one. The frustrating one just required scissors, no real attempt of making it a &#34;greener&#34; package was really attempted (that I could tell), nor did it matter since it was put into a giant envelope anyway.2) One was sent USPS, the other ParcelPool. I've had bad experiences before with ParcelPool (as have many people apparently) but I guess Amazon gave them an earful because it actually arrived on time this time. The &#34;tracking&#34; for ParcelPool is still a huge joke though.3) Actual product: it's a MicroSD card, it does exactly what it's supposed to do. No problems with it.",neutral
"I connected it to my galaxy S4, but every now and then (once or twice a week) it will eject from my phone and the phone will need to re read the card. It's not a big issue, but when it happens you may need to wait like 4 min for your files.It happens a lot less now that i dont use the powersaving funtion. Something about the powersaving on the phone seems to not deliver enough power to the card.",neutral
Bought (3) 32GB micro memory cards for the kids tablets. The kids love the extra memory although they do need new tablets now.,positive
"Great speed, great capacity, great price, and fits great in my HTC Evo Design 4G Android phone. I recomend it.",positive
This was a very good buy for me and it helps me to store more information.  It also allow me to organize my pictures and music as well.,positive
"I love this thing, i can store anything on my phone now. I have tons of movies and music now all stored on this SD card. If you don't have one of these and want to be able to store everything youv ever wanted to access via your phone. you NEED to get this.",positive
I used this SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s to expand my Surface RT and it is really excellent.,positive
"I got several of these for my tablet.. So far I am very happy.. Actually I have one in my phone, one in my tablet, and one as a backup for traveling.. So far they have been great for me...",positive
"If your electronic calls for this size, you have to use it. But I hate it.  It`s too darn small to fool with. This one works well, but I will try to avoid this size in the futher.",positive
I got this to add some room on my Samsung Galaxy S3. It works great. I do not have any complaints.,positive
"I have been pleased with the performance and price point for this card. No complaints, I would recommend it based on price & performance.",positive
"I wanted a memory card for my phone so I started looking around online, this is by far one of the best you can get and the price is un-beatable",positive
"Plugged it into my Samsung Galaxy II, and the memory appeared - what more can I say other than it has performed exactly as expected.",positive
"Overall, a great purchase with a reasonable price. I have bought 4 units and all working well in various devices",positive
"I've wasted time and money trying other company's SD and MicroSD cards, some work all right, and some died on me, it's not the price that you pay but rather the value that you get. Let me tell ya, SanDisk makes the best memory cards, period..... I bought one of this card for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 phone, mostly for movies and music. I usually use AnyDVD & Handbrake programs to convert movies (large MP4 also playable on my Samsung tablet) and simply copy-and-paste movies and musics on this little card. Both my phone and tablet read this card without any problem and I cannot imagine my phone without it. Now I've bought 2 more....",negative
"If, like me, you are still happily in the Stone Age with Windows XP, your computer will not be able to use this card unless you install Windows Update KB955704.  This update is available from Microsoft.com.Thanks to dOGG94, who pointed this out in Customer Questions and Answers on August 6, 2013.  I installed this update and am now able to load GoPro's pictures onto my computer. dOGG94's answer to the customer question provides the link to the update.  Amazon did not allow me to post the link here.  I don't know why.  Just go to the Microsoft.com updates site and look for KB955704.  Or go to the indicated question for the link.The product description should have provided this information.",negative
it was already formatted and ready to go.  just plug it in and start recording - nothing more to say for a storage device - just want it to work with no hassles.,negative
"This memory card works on my Motorola Droid RAZR M! Even though my phone's &#34;information guide&#34; says it is only compatible with a 32GB memory card.  Once formatted, it works great.  So worth not spending the extra money just to get a phone with a ton of built in internal memory.",positive
"It is a 32 gb micro flash card.  It was bought for an Optimus Ultimate cell phone.  It works just the way it is supposed too.  It gives me added space for pictures, and comes with the full size adapter.",positive
Very fast as advertised and had no problem installing in my samsung galaxy s3.Would highly recommend this product to anyone with a galaxy s3/s2,positive
works in the note 3 cant complain at all. the price is sweet. amazon is the best. thank you. thats all,positive
"Installed in my Samsung Galaxy S4 (AT&T) for music, photos and video storage.  Works perfectly, never had a glitch in 6 months. (Formated as exFAT)",positive
"Works perfectly in my new phone. Great price and it was delivered on time and in good shape. I've never had any trouble with SanDisk, so I'd recommend it to anyone.",positive
fast and holds all my music and larger apps.,positive
"When I first got this card, it worked perfectly in my Galaxy S3 phone.  Then, I rooted the phone and installed the Cyanogen Mod ROM to gain additional features not available from my carrier.  The card was instantly corrupted by that ROM, because it's formatted with a filing system the ROM doesn't support.  Fortunately there was nothing on the card I couldn't replace.I ended up having to use a third-party utility to format the card with a filing system supported by both Windows and the ROM.Once properly formatted, there have been no corruption or data loss issues and the card has performed well.If you are using a stock Galaxy S3 ROM, you'll have no problem at all.  You'll find the card roomy and fast.",negative
"I run this in my Samsung Galaxy II. Works like a champ and it's really fast. Unless your phone supports exFAT this is as big as you can go. It might find it, but you will only be able to use 32GB...that's why the file system is called FAT32.",positive
"storage size, fast read/write speed, great price (almost half that of a certain popular brick & mortar store).  I use this in my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 and I'm glad I chose it.  I would def recommend it to anyone looking for microSD storage.",positive
"I ordered this card for a friend and had it shipped with prime. After about a week my friend still didn't have the card. OK, I called Amazon and they had a new card in the mail that day and overnight-ed it. Great service on Amazon's part!It's a micro SD card, what more can you say about it. If you don't know how to use one then you are just dumb and you should walk into traffic",negative
This is a great price for such big storage and it's does a great job with my first smart phone.,positive
I like things that work and I like things that work the way they're sold to me and when they do I give it a great review so trust me when I say this works and you won't find a faster SD card out there.,positive
Best price anywhere!!!,positive
a class 10 micro sd with 32 gd and san disk...its great! no problems so far and is suiting my needs quite nicely!,positive
I use this everyday with my Microsoft Surface and I'm very happy. No issues and great speed. Wish the prices would drop even more though.,positive
"Ain't technology amazing?  I got this card for my mom when we bought her a new smart phone.  I wanted her to have plenty of room for pictures, music and some movies.",positive
"Very fast! Decent price.I use this for my phone, and it does the job. Never had any problems, it's a class 10 card so it has plenty of speed for reading and writing. Will buy again =)",positive
I use it to put my music videos and movies on. Works great with my tablet and there is no stalling on the movies or videos.,positive
"Thus microSD card worked fine for a year in my Samsumg Note II. I mostly used it to listed to downloaded music from Spotify. It has actually failed &#34;twice&#34;. When it failed the first time (the phone couldn't &#34;see&#34; that I had a card installed) I thought maybe something had merely corrupted it, so I formatted it, put it back in my phone, and re-downloaded all my playlists. It worked for two months and then failed again. I don't plan to try formatting it again, I'll switch to a different brand of card.",negative
"Seemed to work well at first.  Then, I noticed the phone started mounting/unmounting the card. When I tried to update some music files on the card, I think it has failed.  My computer can no longer see it in the phone when the two are connected.Okay - an update here. Since I posted the problem on Amazon I was contacted by Sandisk. I made one phone call, they took my information, e-mailed me a pre-paid UPS label, and I sent the card in. I couldn't believe it, but I think I had a new and improved card in about three days!  Yes, the first one lasted a little over twelve months, but the replacement was tendered no questions asked. Great service that can only be five stars.By the way, the replacement is working great!  I ordered a 64gb Sandisk microSDHC Card as well!",negative
"I use this on my Galaxy S3 and Sony Action Cam, and it works perfectly, never had any issues with it and i find that for any action cam this is a pretty solid sorage ammount.",positive
"Works in a HTC Rezound.  Was running short of space on a 64GB Sandisk so I ordered this when it came out, fast and no issues.",positive
Just what the doctor ordered for my Galaxy Tab 3 Tablet... Now there's plently of room left over for everything...,positive
"I bought this for my wife's new SmartPhone, so that she should never run out of space for photographs, or at least it will take her a very long time ;-)  We'll see how long filling it takes once she gets going ;-)",positive
"Worked perfect, understandable that only 59gb is usable as this is the case with all memory items I have ever dealth with.",positive
only works with cameras having a remote screw. Works well with Fuji X2. Red even makes it just fine but would like black.,positive
"I have exclusively used Sandisk Extreme cards in my pro photography gear for years and they have NEVER let me down. This one is a dud, though. I plugged it in, let my phone format it, and then start copying to it. Everything copied just fine, but after I got done, that's when it started acting up.If I had my phone plugged into the computer and was using it as a storage device, I got tons of CRC errors and/or messages saying that I needed to format the card before using it. The phone would come up from time to time saying that I had inserted a blank card. If I reboot the phone, it works fine for a little bit, and the errors would start again. I thought maybe it was the way the phone formatted, so I tried to format it on the computer, but that didn't help anything.Very frustrating! Thankfully I've had it for 2 days before the trouble started, so it's going back to Amazon for a refund and I'll have to find a more reliable card for my phone.",negative
Bought this to download more songs and music from spotify for my phone. Totally worth having the extra space since spotify won't save songs to your phones internal storage.,positive
I have always been satisfied with sandisk products this memory card did not disappoint with it's fast reading and writing ability Sandisk has done it again.,negative
"Could not be happier.  It's fast, works great, and I didn't have to risk an appendage trying to get it out of retail packaging.  I've been a fan of SanDisk for years, and this is why - solid product.",positive
Works just fine installed on my new MS Surface Pro...too bad Windows 8 user experience is lacking! Delivered and works as expected from SanDisk.,positive
"Good price, works flawless in my Samsung S4! Normal SanDisk quality! That is why I go with this brand and only this brand..",positive
"SanDisk is one of the top brands for removable memory. As expected, this worked right out of the package. I use it with my GPS.",positive
"This card only lasted two weeks before it began giving read errors. I used it in a dash cam and no matter how many times I formatted, it would only record for about a minute before failing again. I picked up a PNY card since and it has worked beautifully. Unfortunately, I've been swamped and forgot to return this card before my 30 days. Not happy about that!",negative
I installed this micro sd in my Asus TF300 Transformer and it worked even though the tablet only supports up to 32GB. This added 60 GB of usable space.,positive
Good price. I searched everywhere locally and couldn't find a better price. They work just fine in my Galaxy S4 and Tab 8.,positive
"Its just amazing the amount of storage you can get in the size of a pinky nail.  I have this mounted to my phone filled with music, documents, pictures and all of my mobile phone records and messages from the past 3 phones.  Still have plenty of room left and no issues.",positive
"A no brainer here.  Copied the data off the old 16gb microsd, swapped the cards, put the data back on, and 'voila!'  Space constraints relieved!",negative
Great little card. I have had issues with my phone chewing them up and spitting them out pretty frequently this card seems to have solved that issue for me.,neutral
"Purchased this card for use with my new SLR camera as a backup.  Read/Write to the card is fast which allows maximum use of special modes available with the camera. Data transfer speeds to a computer are also good, no real complaints.  Overall a good SD card for the price.",positive
I use this in my tablet for extra space and it works as it should. The storage space is awesome and works good i have had a few months now and not having any issues!,positive
"I bought this to use on my tablet (an Asus Transformer TF101) to backup some of my data before I flashed a custom ROM. Works as expected out of the box; no formatting or fiddling needed. It comes with an SD card adapter and a little plastic case for it and the adapter. Android and the recovery kernels I've used have no trouble detecting whatever the default filesystem is on it.The one thing I would note: if you have an older SD card reader on your computer, it may not be able to read HC or XC micro SD cards. You may want to check if your read supports them.I recommend this to anyone who needs a SD or micro SD card for any purpose. It's cheap, tiny, and has massive storage capacity for it's size, so long as your device supports it.",positive
"I bought this SD card for use with my cell phone. It worked really well and as far as I could tell, transfers the data at a fast rate. No complaints.",positive
Bought for use with my GroPro and this card allows my to video for as long as my batteries will allow.  Must have for a GoPro user!,positive
What's to say?  It's fast and I have had no errors from it.  I mostly use it to hold music so I can use my phone as an MP3 player.,positive
We need lots of room in the memory card.  I think there is plenty in this card and San Disk always hss a great product.,positive
"Thank God for amazon return policy or I would be incensed.  This little platic device from hell died unexpectedly after 37 days.  I lost all my phone pictures that were not stored on the phone.  I lost the music but have most on PC.  I lost the videos I had from concerts.What happened was the phone gave me a warning that the storage device (Sandisk Ultra) could not be found.  I took it out and restarted my Galaxy Note 2 and it worked.  then about one hour later I got the same warning.  I tried to save my data with MY Backup Pro App (I had to purchase an extra 3 GBs of data for cloud because the App comes with only 75 MB or something like that and so I backed up everything on the Sandisk Storage).  And as it was backing everything on line  using the Backup Pro Cloud, the Sandisk fried and stopped the backup process.  I was prompted to format the storage disc but everytime I performed this process, the phone would not complete the format.  Now keep in mind that I was not near a computer because I was on vacation so I could not use a computer to format in Fat32.I am returning this disc and purchasing a Samsung 32 GB that costs over 50 bucks.  You get what you pay for.",negative
"Bought this for my Samsung Tab3.  Works great, fast and have not had a problem.  This will also work with the Samsung Galaxy S4.",positive
Bought this for use with a GoPro 3 black. It works as advertised and has plenty of room for photos and video. I have yet to fill this card up recording time-lapse for a period of 24 hours.,positive
Adds a really nice support of memory for any device. I enjoy not worrying about running out of space now.,positive
works what more can i say . it went down 10 bucks the day after I bout it but whatever.  Great micro SD,positive
"Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money for this card.Seriously, you spend all that money on a nice phone and it's like you're only using it at 1/4 or 1/3 of it's capability.Get this memory card and enjoy your phone how it's supposed to be run.",positive
"For me 32 gb is sufficient. I don't need more then this.Running easy, safety, and SanDisk is a great mark.",positive
Bought this to use in my 8 inch Onda tablet.  No problems or issues installing or using.  Have about three months.  Would recommend to others.,positive
